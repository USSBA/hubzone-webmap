<p>If you have the street address of a location of interest, simply enter it in the form at the top of the page.</p>
<p>HUBZone Mapping will find that address and zoom the map to street level to display it, while generating a description of whether the location is in a Qualified Census Tract, a HUBZone non-metropolitan county, or other HUBZone area, such as a de-commissioned former military base, an Indian Land area, or a HUD-defined Difficult Development Area (outside the continental US). This action will also pop up an “info table,” which will have a tab for the tract and county within which the address is located, and additional tabs of information for any other HUBZone qualified area(s) that surround the location.</p>
<p>You can also use the map navigation tools at the top left of the Map to pan and zoom to an area of interest.  Then you can determine eligibility either by looking at the Map’s color themes or by clicking at a point on the map with the blue “I” button (in the upper left hand corner of the map) to generate the result.  If you have clicked on a point that is near a street, and that block’s data is complete (with address ranges as most are) HUBZone Mapping will “reverse geocoded,” i.e., fill in the address form (at the top) with the street address and zip code.</p>
