# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

The five-year map cycle enables small businesses to plan and invest in their HUBZone communities without fear that their designation may change from one year to the next, thus providing stability for both the community and HUBZone businesses. However, some areas will cycle off before 2028. For example, HUBZones that are newly designated as Redesignated Areas will expire on July 1, 2026, and areas designated as Qualified Disaster Areas or Governor-designated Areas may expire throughout the year.</p><p>Certified HUBZone firms that are no longer eligible on July 1, 2023, due to the map change may continue to participate in the HUBZone program through their following annual recertification.

Please be aware that using this method will return only GPS coordinates for the location.</p>"
      question_two:
        title_html: "What if the map places the marker in the wrong place?"
        body_html: "Sometimes the Map may place the location marker incorrectly, especially in places where less geocoding data is available, like Puerto Rico. If you believe the map marker is not placed correctly, you can click or tap the Map to place a marker in the correct location. Please be aware that using this method will return only GPS coordinates for the location."
      question_three:
        title_html: "What if my location does not have an address?"
        body_html: "<p>If you know the GPS coordinates for the location, you can type them into the search bar. Use the format: 38.93655, -77.01993.  Always list latitude first, longitude second and do not use the degree \"°\" symbol.

Please be aware that using this method will return GPS coordinates for the location and not a street address.</p>"
      question_four:
        title_html: "Why does my address have an expiration date?"
        body_first_html: "<p>If your address is located in a Redesignated HUBZone or Base Closure Area, it will show an expiration date under the qualification status. If you see an expiration date, it means that the location is currently qualified for the HUBZone program, but it will no longer be qualified after the expiration date.</p>"
        body_second_html: "<p>If you see multiple expiration dates in the additional details section the address is located in multiple overlapping HUBZones. Each type of HUBZone has its own qualification and expiration rules. You should use the more distant date (the date that is shown right under the qualification status) as the date when the address will no longer be qualified for the HUBZone Program.</p>"
